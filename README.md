# PPP_2023 - MultiStage
The 'MultiStage' game for Professional Practice and Placement 2023

'MultiStage' is a 2-stage speedrunning game where the player's main objective is to complete each stage as fast as possible.

The time scores of each player are recorded and uploaded to an API which is powered by Laravel. The game sends and retrieves these scores using GET and POST requests
which are coded into the game.
